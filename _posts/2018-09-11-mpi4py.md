Based on [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22458298/extending-python-with-c-pass-a-list-to-pyarg-parsetuple) it seems 
not easy to parse a numpy array. There are 3 ways to `MPI_Allreduce` a numpy array
+ Use List Object API as mentioned on that page
+ Use `boost::python`
+ Use `mpi4py`
    + a good tutorial is [link](https://info.gwdg.de/~ceulig/docs-dev/doku.php?id=en:services:application_services:high_performance_computing:mpi4py)
