The setting of this problem is from [DOI 10.1002/aic.11971]: 
+ diameter of the tubes $$D=0.03m$$
+ dimension of the domain $$L = [29D, 21D]$$
+ center of tubes $$c_{ij}=(4.5D+2Dj, L[1]-1.5D-2Di)$$ for $$i,j\in\{0,\cdots,9\}$$
+ boundary condition
    + left: inflow, velocity = (1,0)
    + top and bottom: no-slip, velocity = (0,0)
    + right: outflow
+ density  $$\rho = 1.2 kg/m^3$$
+ viscosity $$\mu = 1.8e^{-5}kg/m/s$$
